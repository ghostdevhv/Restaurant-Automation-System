# Restaurant Automation System (RAS):

A restaurant owner wants to computerize his order processing, billing, and accounting activities. He also expects
the computer to generate statistical report about sales of different items. A major goal of this computerization
is to make supply ordering more accurate so that the problem of excess inventory is avoided as well as the
problem of non-availability of ingredients required to satisfy orders for some popular items is minimized. The
computer should maintain the prices of all the items and also support changing the prices by the manager.
Whenever any item is sold, the sales clerk would enter the item code and the quantity sold. The computer
should generate bills whenever food items are sold. Whenever ingredients are issued for preparation of food
items, the data is to be entered into the computer. Purchase orders are generated on a daily basis, whenever
the stock for any ingredient falls below a threshold value. The computer should calculate the threshold value
for each item based on the average consumption of this ingredient for the past three days and assuming that a
minimum of two days stock must be maintained for all ingredients. Whenever the ordered ingredients arrive,
the invoice data regarding the quantity and price is entered. If sufficient cash balance is available, the computer
should print cheques immediately against invoice. Monthly sales receipt and expenses data should be generated
whenever the manger would request to see them. The computer should be able to print a menu card containing
the menu items and their prices.
